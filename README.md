# EchoLynx – Cybersecurity Lab & Portfolio

Hi! I’m **EchoLynx** – an aspiring offensive security engineer and content creator.  
I document my learning journey through structured notes, TryHackMe walkthroughs, and YouTube videos.

> **Everything here is for legal, ethical training only.**  
> All labs are done on platforms like TryHackMe or systems I own/have explicit permission to test.
