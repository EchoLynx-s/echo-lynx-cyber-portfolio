# EchoLynx – Cybersecurity Lab & Portfolio

Hi! I’m **EchoLynx** – an aspiring offensive security engineer and content creator.  
I document my learning journey through structured notes, TryHackMe walkthroughs, and YouTube videos.

> **Everything here is for legal, ethical training only.**  
> All labs are done on platforms like TryHackMe or systems I own/have explicit permission to test.

## What I’m focusing on right now

- Building a **solid foundation** in networking & security (CCNA + TryHackMe Pre Security).
- Practising **offensive techniques safely** using guided labs.
- Turning lab work into **clean notes, GitHub write-ups, and YouTube content**.

---

##  Repository structure

I use a very simple rule:

- **1 repo per TryHackMe room or video**, tracked in Notion.
- **1 repo (or small set of repos) per bigger course/path** like CCNA.

This portfolio repo is just the **home page** that links you to everything.
